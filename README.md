Welcome to the GSAP Workshop repository! This project contains the tasks and exercises I completed while learning GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP).

## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to my journey of learning GSAP, a powerful JavaScript library for creating animations. The tasks included here demonstrate various features and capabilities of GSAP, showcasing animations for web projects.

## Installation

To get started with the repository, clone it to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gsap-workshop.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd gsap-workshop
```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the animations in action.

## Tasks

This section outlines the tasks I completed during the workshop:

1. **Basic Animations**: Introduction to GSAP's core animation functions.
2. **Timeline Animations**: Creating complex animations using timelines.
3. **Stagger Animations**: Animating multiple elements with staggered effects.
